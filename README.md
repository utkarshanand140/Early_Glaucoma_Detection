# Glaucoma_Infyuva

- Worked on developing Mask-Red-CNN based Deep Learning Model for Fundus Image Classifications for
early detection of Glaucoma in patients.
- Focused specifically on reducing False Negatives.
- Successfully tackled working with limited dataset and increased model accuracies to almost 94% through
various data augmentation techniques.
- Deployed the model on In-House built cheap, affordable and portable retinal imaging device.
